# Realtime Behavior Analysis 
To assert a better feedback mechanism in a traditional classroom environment we propose using computer vision and machine learning techniques for real-time, objective analysis of student emotions and teacher behavior simultaneously Using a Combined model the two combined models are:
- **Facial Expression**
- **Body Language Classifier**


## Facial Expression
- Video capture using python CV.
- Uses Cascade Classifier to detect faces
- CNN then classifies the detected faces to predefined categories
  - Happy
  - Sleepy
  - Angry
  - Neutral
  - Fear

  - Trainable params: 13,103,431
  - Non-trainable params: 7,936
  - Accuracy:  88.64 %

  Loss function Used: **Categorical Cross-Entropy**

## Body Language Classification
- Utilizes [MediaPipe Holistic](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/solutions/holistic.md) to classify body poses from video data into specific categories:
  - Writing
  - Active Explaining
  - Passive Explaining
  - At Desk

- Pose Estimation model was trained on lectures videos from MIT Open Course Ware.
- Frames from the video lectures were first converted to RGB format, Mediapipe holistic model was used to extract landmarks.
- Landmarks from 10 such frames were contacted then written to csv along with class name
- This data-set was then fed to a Random Forrest model to which classifies into the given categories.
- Next step was to create a composite model that incorporates both the models, leveraging the strengths of both models and providing a holistic view.
